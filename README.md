# SwiftBot Work Repository – CS1704
Welcome to your repository!

The CS1814 Software Implementation Assessment requires you to demonstrate sufficient aptitude in planning, managing, and tracking a non-trivial activity (LO5). This year, we will use your GitHub Classroom activity to evaluate how effectively you have met this learning outcome. 
Working toward your coding assignment includes completing the weekly lab tasks and writing practice programs to build the necessary skills. Therefore, this repository should be used to store all of your SwiftBot-related Java work for CS1704, including:
- Weekly lab exercises (e.g., _DoesMySwiftBotWork, Calibrate Your SwiftBot_)
-	Formative Task 2
-	Any work for Assignment 3 – CS1814 Software Implementation

##What you need to do:
-	You will have only one repository for CS1704.
-	Create **one Maven-enabled Java project** for the entire module. Give the project a suitable name that reflects its purpose.
-	For each new task, create **a separate class file** rather than creating additional projects. Choose an appropriate class name that reflects its purpose and makes its role in the program clear. For example, you can name each class according to its purpose, (e.g., _DoesMySwiftBotWork, CalibrateMySwiftBot, SimonSwift, TestRandomColourGenerator_).
-	For **work already completed**, copy and paste it into the Maven-enabled Java project you created, then upload the project to GitHub Classroom.
-	**Commit your work early and often**. This is good Git practice and allows us to see steady progress (LO5) rather than large uploads at the end.

Regular commits also help you maintain version control, avoid data loss, and meet the activity expectation outlined in the brief.

##IMPORTANT
-	Work that is not pushed to this repository will not be considered when evaluating LO5.
-	Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure your repository is up to date.
The purpose of this GitHub repository is only to evaluate your planning and progress towards Assignment 3 (LO5). The code (i.e., your .java files) you wish to be considered towards the CS1814 assignment must be uploaded to WiseFlow on or before the submission deadline (refer to the assignment brief for more information). In the event that you have not uploaded your code to WiseFlow, or the uploaded code is faulty, any code stored in this repository will **not** be considered a valid submission. You will **not be permitted** to access this repository during the viva.

If you have any issues with Git or GitHub, please ask during the lab sessions.
